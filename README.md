# 🌐 WEBDEV ADVENTURE

**WEBDEV ADVENTURE** is a collaborative website project built by the AllStartDev team starting from June 2024. The project was developed as part of the *WEBDEV ADVENTURE* competition by a group of university students passionate about web development.

My role in the team was **Frontend Developer** — I was responsible for building the UI of the website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Feel free to check out the source code and explore the adventure we built!
